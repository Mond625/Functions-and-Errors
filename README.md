# Functions-and-Errors

The project of Module: Functions and Errorsâ€”ETH + AVAX is to write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

to run the program I used Remix Ethereum IDE
To compile the code, click the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Then type how many credits would be placed for require function as depositing credits to the balance then later to revert function to withdraw credits from the balance. Assert is to check if the balance is empty or not
